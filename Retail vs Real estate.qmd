## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(rio)
library(tidyverse)
library(vtable)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(fixest)
library(ggplot2)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
data_finance <- read.csv('data_retail_RealEstate_final.csv')

```

```{r}
cutoff_date <- ('2020-03-01')

data_finance <- data_finance %>%
  mutate(covid = data_finance$date > cutoff_date)

data_finance <- data_finance%>%
  filter(!(IND %in% (c('6470', '6480', '6570', '6590', '6670', '6780', '7080', '7181', '7190'))))
```

```{r}
data_finance <- data_finance %>%
  group_by(indname, date) %>%
  mutate(no_employed = sum(EMPSTAT == 10, na.rm = TRUE))
data_only_finance <- data_finance %>%
  filter(indname == 'Finance and Insurance, and Real Estate and Rental and Leasing')

```

```{r}
did_r<- feols(log(no_employed) ~ covid, data = data_retail)

etable(did_r)
```

In the presence of Covid, the number of employees in the retail industry is 27.02% lower then prior to Covid.

```{r}
did_fr <- feols(log(no_employed) ~ indname + covid + indname * covid, data = data_finance)

etable(did_fr)
```

The presence of covid is associated with a 4.24% lager drop in employment for the retail industry than for the finance and real estate industries.

```{r}
did_f<- did_r<- feols(log(no_employed) ~ covid, data = data_only_finance)

etable(did_f)

```

In the presence of Covid, the employment in the finance industry is 22.27% lower than prior to covid.
