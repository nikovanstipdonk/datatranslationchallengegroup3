## Libraries

```{r}
library(rio)
library(tidyverse)
library(vtable)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(fixest)
library(ggplot2)
```

Read in Cleaned Data

```{r}
info_retail_data <- read.csv('data/retail_info_final.csv')


```

Add cutoff dates and assign treatment

```{r}
cutoff_date <- ('2020-03-01')

info_retail_data <- info_retail_data%>%
  mutate(covid = info_retail_data$date > cutoff_date)

info_retail_data <- info_retail_data%>%
  filter(!(IND %in% (c('6470', '6480', '6570', '6590', '6670', '6780'))))

```

```{r}
info_retail_data <-info_retail_data %>%
  group_by(indname, date, covid) %>%
  summarize(no_employed = sum(EMPSTAT == 10, na.rm = TRUE))





  
data_retail_v_info <- info_retail_data %>%
  filter(indname == 'Retail Trade')

data_info_v_retail <- info_retail_data %>%
  filter(indname == 'Information')
```

```{r}
retail_health <- feols(log(no_employed) ~ covid, data = data_retail_v_info)

etable(retail_health)
```

CORRECT: In the presence of Covid, there is a 19.18% decrease in the log number of employees in the retail industry.

```{r}
r_v_i_health <- feols(log(no_employed) ~ indname + covid + indname * covid, data = info_retail_data)

etable(r_v_i_health)
```

The presence of covid is associated with a 7.92% greater drop in employment for the retail industry than for the information services industry.

```{r}
info_health <- feols(log(no_employed) ~ covid, data = data_info_v_retail)
etable(info_health)
```

The presence of Covid is associated with a 11.26% drop in employment in the information industry.

Notes; Interrupted time series type for rdd with date as running var centered on march first.
